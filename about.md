NLarn is a [roguelike game](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php?title=What_a_roguelike_is) and as such a remake of the classic game [Larn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_(video_game)).

My intention when starting this project was to get a copy of Larn that one could actually play: I just couldn't stand the user interface of the original. To improve it, I peeked into the original code, which revealed to be unmaintainable. So a rewrite seemed to be the best idea - and that is what I did.

As I never _really_ played Larn, NLarn might be quite different to Larn in certain areas, but at least I tried to follow the original. Some aspects of Larn's game-play (which I only experienced by reading the code) seemed a bit weird and didn't suit my taste, so I changed them intentionally. Other changes are caused by the unreadability of Larn's code.

As today's computers are a bit more advanced compared to those in the eighties, I could do a completely different approach to how things are handled under the cover.

Very noticeable differences to the original so far include:
* advanced user interface
* extremely different item handling
* extended monster AI
* a real town
* "graphical" effects
* colour
