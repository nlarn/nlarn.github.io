As SourceForge seems to die slowly and has proven very unreliable early this
year, I've decided to move the entire project to GitHub.

The source code, the issue tracker, the wiki, and the homepage are now hosted
on GitHub. Only downloads for older releases remain on SourceForge.

And yes, this is a clear sign that I picked up the game again and decided to
continue working on it. I plan on releasing an update which will focus on bug
fixes and balancing in the near future (lesson learned in the past: precise
dates and release announcements should not appear in the same sentence).

After that release I'll continue working on unfinished features, e.g. the
*summon daemon* spell.
