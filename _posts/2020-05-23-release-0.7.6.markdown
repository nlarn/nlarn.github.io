New month, new features. This release mainly seeks to fix the macOS package, which was broken in 0.7.5.
But also some other bugs, that only affected first time players were fixed and last but not least casting the spell "fireball" finally works in all cases and places on the maps.

But also something new will sure delight the heart of any adventurer: some monsters will now appear in packs and move through the caverns together.

Games created by the previous version 0.7.5 are compatible and can be continued.
