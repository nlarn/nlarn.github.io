I have uploaded version 0.3 to Sourceforge.

This is the first release and it's already quite playable. Quite a way to what I had in mind but in many points much more advanced than the original. I was quite amazed how long it took to get this done.

## Known Bugs

* Saving the game is not possible.
* The combat system sucks. You might get the message "GLib assertion failed" when your strength is low. Redraw the screen with CTRL-L.

Enjoy!
